# CMPM121-Final

## Introducing the team

Tools Lead: Frank Shi

## Tools and materials

Our team is planning on using the Phaser framework with Typescript for our project. We chose to work with the Phaser framework because we all have
experience using it from CMPM-120. Phaser also builds on the Javascript language and library, which has some ties with 
the Typescript language we've been practicing in CMPM-121.

We're planning to use Typescript, JSON, and HTML for our project. We chose to use these tools because we've been practicing using them
for the majority of the class. These tools are a necessity for creating a well-functioning website, which was another big reason why we 
chose to use them.

The main IDE we're all going to be using is Visual Studio Code and the live server extension built into VSCode. As for the image editor, 
we're planning on using Aseprite and Tiled to create our game's visual assets. The main reason why we chose to use these tools is
because of prior experience using them from CMPM-120.

Our main alternate platform would be transitioning to using Javascript instead of Typescript, but still using the Phaser framework.

## Outlook

We want to try including procedural audio in our game, as well as original music and sound effects. We also want to attempt
to create a more customizable experience for the player in the form of an options menu, as well as giving the player more
accessibility options such as cross-platorm, color blindness mode, subtitles, high-contrast mode, voice narration, and adjustable difficulty levels.

Our main concern is not being able to use certain interfaces for our project.

We're hoping to make our project adaptable and continue to polish our Javascript and Typescript skills. On top of that, we're
hoping to keep our code maintainable.
